# Tutorial 10

## A. MyExperience

It's time to fill out MyExperience!!

## B. Visitor Pattern

In this scenario we have `Computer`s, `Keyboard`s and `Mouse`s which all are of type `ComputerComponent`. We want to be able to 'visit' different types of Computer components by logging the following messages:

```
Looking at computer Corelli with memory 500 GB.
Looking at keyboard Mechanical keyboard which has 36 keys.
Looking at mouse Bluetooth mouse.
```

In particular though, anyone which is visiting a `Computer` must be **validated** prior to being able to visit.

Extend/modify the starter code to use the Visitor Pattern to allow different computer components to be visited.

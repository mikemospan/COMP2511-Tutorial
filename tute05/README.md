# Tutorial 05 - State, Strategy, Observer

In this tute you'll cover;
- State Pattern
- Strategy Pattern
- Observer Pattern

as well as the basics of SSO (Single Sign On) and authentication to help you with the lab.

### State-Strategy-Observer or SSO (pun intended)

In the lab you'll be implementing an single sign on (SSO) system to allow you to login/signup users to an application through the use of many strategies such as Hoogle, FaceTome, and InstaHam.

To help you begin with implementing that let's discuss the basic mechanics behind SSO and how it works.

| :information_source:â€‡ NOTE: This problem has been massively trivialised and is more focused on the browser side changes in user state.  This is so that very little network domain knowledge is required to be able to solve the lab.  It invents it's own protocol that is *roughly* based on OAuth2 (nowadays it's more common to use SAML due to numerous issues with OAuth but SAML is significantly more complicated). |

#### Authentication

> Authentication is confirming that the user is who they say they are, and authorization is the act of giving users permission to a set of resources/actions.  We are merely concerned with authentication (i.e. 'login') in this lab/tute.

1. Why do we need authentication for websites such as gmail/myunsw/facebook?
2. Does anyone know what SSO / External Login is?
3. Let's look at the below SSO flow and talk about the following concepts
  - Session cookies
  - Does this look like any concept we've discussed this week?

    <summary>SSO Flow</summary>

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    User->>App: Visit Website
    alt has credentials
    App->>User: Redirect to home page (done)
    else invalid credentials
    App->>User: Redirect to login
    User-->>+Provider: Decide on provider and login
    Provider->>-User: Redirect to application with access token
    User->>+App: Redirect with access token
    App->>+Provider: Validate access token
    Provider->>-App: Access token status
    alt access token valid
    alt user exists under provider
    else user doesn't exist at all
    App->>User: Registration form for user details
    User->>App: Registration details
    App->>App: Create user and link provider
    else user exists but not under provider
    App->>App: Link user to provider
    alt user is locked
    App->>App: Unlock user
    end
    end
    App->>App: Convert access token
    App->>-User: Redirect to home page (done)
    else Acess token invalid
    App->>User: Error page due to invalid login
    end
    end
```

</details>

A few more details that aren't explicit in the above system;
- Providers may require different methods to login (username + password, email + password, two factor authentication, unique code sent via email, and so on...)
- The access code will be the following object (for all providers)

```javascript
{
    "email": "<email address of user>",
    "access_token": "<some generated token>",
    "expires_at": "<local date with when this will expire>"
}
```

- Providers are linked to a common user via the email address

The above diagram may be a bit hard to process (due to it's very concise nature) so to help you understand the flow let's break it down into a series of questions.

### Design Patterns A) State

1. What do state patterns allow you to cleanly represent
2. What is a state table and why are they useful in this case
3. Write a state table for the above problem.

### Design Patterns B) Strategy

1. How could you use the strategy pattern in this example
2. Give an example of why that's useful here, and the benefits of the strategy pattern over just if statements.

### Design Patterns C) Observer

In this example we won't be implementing actual frontends / webservers to run this (due to the extra complexity that requires) and will instead be using observer patterns to simulate asynchronous requests.

An example is shown below (from one of the provided tests in the lab)

```java
// Create a provider
Provider hoogle = new Hoogle();
hoogle.addUser("user@hoogle.com.au", "1234");

ClientApp app = new ClientApp();
// Allow users to login using hoogle
app.registerProvider(hoogle);

// Create a browser instance
Browser browser = new Browser();
// Visit our client application
browser.visit(app);

// Since the browser has no initial login credentials
// it'll cause us to redirect to a page to select providers
assertEquals(browser.currentPage, ClientApp.Page.ProviderSelection);

// Select the provider and get a form
Form form = currentTab.selectProvider(hoogle);
assertEquals(browser.currentPage, ClientApp.Page.ProviderForm);

// Fill in the form using the provider
form.fillIn(Hoogle.generateFormSubmission("user@hoogle.com.au", "1234"));

// This should inform the browser that the form is filled
// Which will then authenticate the form with the third party provider
// which causes the browser to redirect back to the login page with token
// which causes the client application to validate the token
// resulting in a redirect back to the home page.
assertEquals(browser.currentPage, ClientApp.Page.HomePage);
```

1. Why is the observer pattern useful here?  Think about encapsulation and trying to prevent every function from just being public.
2. What parts of the above procedure could utilise observers

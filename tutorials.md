# COMP2511 Tutor Guidelines for Tutorials

## Tutorial Management

- Students will need to join the teams call via their UNSW teams login.

- Before your tutorial starts, create at least 6 breakout rooms (have some empty ones in case people want to chat one on one)

- Instructions on using breakout rooms can be found [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-breakout-rooms-in-teams-meetings-7de1f48a-da07-466c-a5ab-4ebace28e461#bkmk_createrooms)

- In coming weeks once we've adjusted to teaching over teams we'll add to these notes

## Participation Marks Collection

- Students receive a mark out of 1 for their participation in each tutorial consisting of the following:
    * 0.5 marks for attending
    * 0.5 marks for participating by asking/answering questions

- Encourage students to put their webcam on from the start of the first tutorial - it will make their class experience more interactive and your teaching experience infinitely better. You should have your webcam on.

- Take a screenshot of the meeting participants after roughly 5 minutes in the tutorial which shows the list and whether they have their webcam on or not.

- If you're doing a coding question, you can simply write down the students who answered your questions or contributed as a comment on the side of your code for you to give them participation marks later as well as acknowledging their contribution, eg.

    ```java
    System.out.println() // suggested by Nick
    ```

- In other cases where students just simply ask a lot of questions make sure you have something open that can be used to quickly write down their names. Can either be typing it in an App on your laptop or writing down on a paper, up to you.

- Don't forget to download the chats at the end of the tutorial or even lab assuming given that it's the same Teams session for 3 hours. Just make sure you do it before you leave the session so that you have a record of any standout participation in case you miss them during the tutorial. Instructions on downloading the chat can be found [here](https://www.technipages.com/microsoft-teams-export-chat-history)

- Lastly try your best to encourage students to turn on their webcam as well as participating both through chat and audio, it is beneficial to both parties, the tutorial becomes more fun and they get marks for it. If they don't have a camera or a microphone tell them they can always join from their phone as a second device just for the tutorial, if that's the case you might want to be careful with using the number of participants to crosscheck with the number of attendance because some people might have more than 1 device.
